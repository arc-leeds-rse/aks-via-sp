# Creating an AKS cluster

## Instructions

1. Change the settings in the settings file:

`RG_NAME=uol_feps_soc_xxxx_xxxx`

You have your own resource group so replace this string with your personal resource group.

2. Run the `create.sh` script. This will create an AKS cluster using the settings from the `settings` file.

3. Run the `test.sh` file to confirm that the cluster is `up` and operational.

4. When you've completed the exercises, delete the cluster by running the `delete.sh` file.
